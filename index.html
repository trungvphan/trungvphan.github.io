								About
							</h4>

							<p class="mt-2 justify">
								Born in Vietnam, the prelude of my life was filled with <a class="link-dark" href="#" onclick="$('#prelude').click()">music, opera, and ballet</a>. During high school (2010-2011), I came to the U.S. through a cultural exchange program. Since then I have graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2015) with a B.Sc. Degree and Princeton University (2021) with a Ph.D. Degree 
								(thesis <a class="link-dark" href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp0112579w380">"Swarm Intelligence in Natural and Synthetic Lives"</a>).
							</p>

							<p class="mt-2 justify">
								I was a postdoc in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University (2021-2023), followed by a postdoc in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (2023-2025) — where I also worked at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute. Since Fall 2025, I have been an Assistant Professor of Physics in the Department of Natural Sciences at the 
								<a class="link-dark" href="https://www.claremont.edu/">Claremont Colleges (Pitzer and Scripps)</a>.
							</p>

							<p class="mt-2 justify">
								My life is blessed with an amazing family, good friends, and great teachers.

							<p class="mt-2">
								I’m a referee for <a class="link-dark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Small, Biophysical Journal</a>, and other scientific journals. In the summer, if time permits I teach enlisted veterans S.T.E.M. and lab skills for <a class="link-dark" href="https://www.warrior-scholar.org/">the Warrior-Scholar Project</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-2">
								I was a Graduate Teaching Fellow at <a class="link-dark" href="https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/">McGraw Center, Princeton University</a>. During my undergrad, I developed some of the notes for high-energy physics courses at M.I.T. OCW and EdX such as <a class="link-dark" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-851-effective-field-theory-spring-2013/">8.851 Effective Field Theory</a> and <a class="link-dark" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-821-string-theory-and-holographic-duality-fall-2014/">8.821 String Theory and Holographic Duality</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-2">
								In my free time, I enjoy collaborating with talented Vietnamese students on a variety of exploratory topics. I also coach the Vietnamese team for Physics Olympiads at the international level (<a class="link-dark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad">IPhO</a> and <a class="link-dark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Physics_Olympiad">APhO</a>), e.g. the invitation to the team send-off in <a class="link-dark" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcFDf5DrtDC7jcS_mb1QfG3wGSZlF-qd/view">2025</a>. My hope is to support my home country further and help inspire the next generation of physicists.

								My early life
							</h4>

							<p class="mt-2 justify">
								Born into a family of artists -- with playwright, ballet dancer, and many orchestral musicians -- I spent much of my early life outside school at the <a href="https://nhahatnhacvukichvietnam.com/en/about-us/#history" class="link-dark" target="_blank">Vietnam National Opera and Ballet Theater</a>, exploring what I could be when I grow up. Though my artistic journey did not lead to a professional career, it still left me with memories I will always treasure.
							</p>

							<p class="mt-2 justify">
								Fun fact: I first came to the U.S. in 2007, right after <a href="https://vn.usembassy.gov/chronology-of-u-s-vietnam-relations/#2007" class="link-dark" target="_blank">Vietnam and the U.S. fully normalized diplomatic relations</a>. I was part of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lGQBwMuuFP9L794zkoGsB7VYnZie3j7-/view" class="link-dark" target="_blank">Vietnam Children's Choir</a> — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpwO0aGUCjDKPTVU0126S0t1KOiDtEMs/view" class="link-dark" target="_blank">the largest group ever approved by the Vietnamese government to visit the U.S. at the time</a>. We perform across many states, including with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernacle_Choir" class="link-dark" target="_blank">Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square</a> -- singing in the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Tabernacle" class="link-dark" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tabernacle</a>. That wonderful experience sparked a dream of returning to the U.S. one day ...

									The 2024 Nobel laureate in physics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopfield" class="link-dark" target="_blank">John Hopfield</a>, published his <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554" class="link-dark" target="_blank">groundbreaking 1982 paper on neural networks in PNAS</a> because "no physics journal would accept it as physics." As humanity advances, our understanding of physics continues to expand beyond contemporary textbook definitions. This year, the American Physical Society's mission <a href="https://www.aps.org/about/mission-vision-values" class="link-dark" target="_blank">underscores the importance of diverse, interdisciplinary approaches to address global challenges</a>. This aligns with my vision, as much of my work has focused on pushing the boundaries of where physics can be applied — particularly to the study of emergent behaviors and complex social dynamics, which are central to today's evolving conception of physics.

								<div class="pub-congress mt-1">Natural complex topologies form challenging existential puzzles for bacteria. Billions of years of evolution have shaped the response of bacteria to these puzzles, whose solutions can be found in how bacteria such as the common E. coli respond collectively and individually to challenges. We pose challenges to bacteria in the forms of mazes and fractal spaces, showing the unexpected and clever (if we can say that word about bacteria) way in which they are able to efficiently explore nontrivial mazes in times much shorter than a no-memory walk would predict, and can collectively escape from a fractal topology.</div>

								<div class="pub-congress mt-1">Social physics explores responses to information exchange in a social network and can be mapped onto bacterial collective signaling. Here, we investigate how social inter-bacterial communication involves the coordination of responses to communication loss, as opposed to solitary foraging behavior, with collective responses emerging at the population level. We present a two-dimensional enclosed microfluidic environment featuring concentric rings of funnel ratchets, which direct motile E. coli bacteria towards a single exit, an information "black hole." Passage into the black hole irreversibly sweeps the bacteria away via hydrodynamic flow. We demonstrate that the spatiotemporal evolution of entropy production reveals how bacteria avoid crossing the hydrodynamic black hole's information horizon.</div>

We release these electronic foragers on an LED screen whose light output was adjusted to mimic the amount of a consumable resource—such as grass for deer. Once the robots “ate” the resource in one place, they can sense that they are in a depleted region and will move in the direction of more food; we call this emergent symmetry-breaking motion “field drive” (which is analogous to the general relativistic “warp drive,” as it is based on the warping of the “resource space” around a robot). This programmed behavior led to collective patterns that resembled phases of matter including liquid, crystal, and glass.</div>

								<div class="pub-congress mt-1">Perhaps someday synthetic life may ultimately co-exist with biological life, and it may learn from biology how to survive. To study a form of robobiology with embedded evolution dynamics which have been so successful for the dominance of biological life, we have developed in emulation of natural systems analog/digital interactive motile robots which move over multiple dynamic resource landscapes that they themselves change. We discover an interesting sector of evolution, in which the survivability of fast-mutating robots can be strongly suppressed under stochastic changes when they respond to resources that they neither consumed nor needed. In biology, the ability of a gene to influence two or more unrelated physical traits is known as pleiotropy, which has been implicated in cancer cells’ resistance to chemotherapy. This finding suggests a way to improve chemotherapy: instead of periodic doses of a single drug, stochastic doses of multiple drugs could be more effective.</div>

									Robots often rely on a finite number of digitized sensors, and the resulting quantization‐error -- sampling a continuous field-signal with discrete levels -- can produce unexpected emergent dynamics. We have found a train of interacting robots that exhibits fractional transport: at certain field-gradient values the collective speed abruptly goes down to zero, and those values obey a well-defined number-theoretic structure. We would like to investigate this curious link between physics and number theory in more depth.
									</span>

								<li class="abme-honors-bullet mt-2">
									<span>
									Robot swarms display phase-like states akin to those in thermodynamics, yet their active nature -- each unit self-propels instead of drifting passively like a molecule -- gives rise to wholly new phenomena, from perpetual vortices to time-crystal-like behavior. We aim to discover and analyze these new phases that can be observed on a specific system of field-driven robots.
									</span>
								</li>

								<li class="abme-honors-bullet mt-2">
									<span>
									Robots driven by competing fields -- some attractive, some repulsive -- can self-organize into blobs that together self-propel coherently. However, the blob stability is non-monotonic -- small and large populations stay intact, while intermediate swarm sizes trigger break-up. Our goal is to chart this size-dependent stability landscape, which could potentially be a simple analogue model of motile cell-splitting.
									</span>
								</li>

								<li class="abme-honors-bullet mt-2">
									<span>
									Machine learning can be trained to predict the dynamics of a system, but it is usually tied to the choice of coordinates and dimensionality/geometry of the experiments. We would like to go beyond that, finding what systems and symmetries that allow machine learning to transcend those ties (so it can e.g. learn bacteria chemotaxis behavior on an 1D channel to predict the emergent phenomenon on a 2D spherical surface), and devise a practical way to implement this coordinate- and dimension-free approach.
									</span>
								</li>

								<li class="abme-honors-bullet mt-2">
									<span>
									Machine learning can discover hidden symmetries, patterns, and structures in data that are otherwise incomprehensible to us. Our goal is to train neural networks that transform complicated dynamics into trivial ones (e.g. intricate motion under a potential to constant motion by adding more dimensions) or ones with elegant geometrical properties (e.g. prey-predator systems to Hamiltonian/Poisson systems defined on symplectic manifolds).

									Supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity (SUGRA) provides a natural explanation for the absence of superpartners in known experiments, while maintaining a near-zero positive cosmological constant. The idea is that AdS SUSY could be a symmetry of nature (not flat space SUSY), where SUSY breaking contributes positively to the vacuum energy, balanced by the negative curvature of AdS. Our goal is to study the mass splitting, their quantum corrections, and anomaly mediation effects within the vector multiplet of AdS SUGRA.
